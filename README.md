# ts-rn-swipe-button

This library is cloned from [UdaySravanK/RNSwipeButton](https://github.com/UdaySravanK/RNSwipeButton) and is converted to functional component as well as update latest react apis by [julien9999](https://github.com/julien9999/RNSwipeButton). My task is only creating a completely react native component under supported by [bob](https://github.com/react-native-community/bob). With bob supporting, this library can work fine on both js and ts projects. I'd like to say thankful for UdaySravank and julien9999.
